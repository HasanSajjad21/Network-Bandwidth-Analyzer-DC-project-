 <h1>Network Bandwidth Analyzer with Cyclic
 Redundancy Check (CRC) and Parity Checker</h1>

 <p>
    The "Network Bandwidth Analyzer with Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Par
ity Checker" is a Java-based project designed to create a network monitoring tool for
 real-time traffic analysis. This tool captures and analyzes network data, detecting and
 reporting errors using CRC and parity-checking techniques. It offers user-friendly in
terfaces, and data visualization, making it a valuable asset for network management
 and performance optimization. The project aims to enhance data integrity and network
 security while providing insights into bandwidth utilization and error statistics.
